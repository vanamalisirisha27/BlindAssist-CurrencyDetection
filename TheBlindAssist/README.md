 This android app will help visual and hearing-impaired persons to detect the Indian Currency Denomination by placing a banknote under the camera.

This is a real-world project which is based on (Research + Applied) machine learning and Android Development. 

We created the Indian Currency Dataset(ICD) for this project which currently has 12,000 images. ICD is a very rich dataset, which contains very diverse images. We have covered all the classes (none, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 2000). Also, we have covered all kind of note's images like older and newer, front and rear, in different lighting conditions etc.


We are using Keras, TensorFlow, Fastai and PyTorch libraries, to leverage the power of all.       
Currently, we have achieved 99% accuracy on ResNet50 and 96% accuracy on MobileNetV2 model

We are using MobileNet model because it runs efficiently and fast on mobile phones.
